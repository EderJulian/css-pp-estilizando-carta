    <h3>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h3>

    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty to study as part
        of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
    Yours sincerely.
    Dr Eleanor Gaye

    <h4>Starting dates</h4>

    <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you
        could start <span class="importante"> at the beginning of a semester</span> ; the start dates for each one are
        as
        follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please let me know if this is ok. and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
    <p>You can find more information about important university dates <a href="#" class="linkcolor">on our website</a>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Subjects of study</h4>

    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just
        the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued
        by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tcmpraturcs exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the
            audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 > 3 x 104.)</li>
        <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the
        research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

    <h4>Exotic dance moves</h4>

    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,
        my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt class="bailes">Polynesian chicken dance</dt>

        <dd class="tabular">A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. a whole village would
            dance around in
            a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful*.</dd>

        <dt class="bailes">Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>

        <dd class="tabular">Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this
            dance, which
            involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in
            impcrccptably tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance
            inspired modem styles such as Twerking.</dd>

        <dt class="bailes">Arctic robot dance</dt>

        <dd class="tabular">An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed
            to have
            discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic*, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants
            of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this
            because they were really cold.</dd>
